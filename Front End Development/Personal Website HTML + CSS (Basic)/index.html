  <p> In my formative years, school was never a priority for me. Skateboarding, wanting to go pro, partying and having fun were the only things on my mind. I just scraped by through the education system and somehow managed to
    get into George Brown College for marketing. It was not what I wanted to do but at 17 it was the expectation of my family that I need to have some kind of post secondary education.
    After I graduated I took up a management job at one of the world's largest rental car companies. The job was decent and the pay was good but there was a lingering feeling that the path I was on was not the right one for me. I did some soul
    searching and landed on computer science since computers were already of interest to me. However, at the time, there was no way my current high school marks would get me into university. So at 24 I went back to Burnhamthorpe Collegiate Adult
    Secondary School for 2 years to acquire the necessary education to attend university while working at the car rental company part time. I was fortunate and grateful to have 3 universities offer me an admittance to their computer science program.
    It looks like hard work does pay off. I remember hearing people say "The hard part isn't getting into university, it's getting through it" and they couldn't have been more correct. Anyone reading this who has pursued an education in CS or a
    related field understands the trials and tribulations we go through. As I'm writing this I have just graduated and am a proud recipient of a BA in Computer Science. I'm excited and ready to start this next chapter in my life and see where it
    takes me.
