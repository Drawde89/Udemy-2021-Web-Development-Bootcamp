Created a personal website/CV using only HTML. The Website consists of 3 HTML pages. index.html uses the basics like headers, paragraphs, line breaks, tables, anchors, lists. hobbies.html has an unordered list of some hobbies of mine. contact.html explores the use of forms and you can email me from that form if you'd like. Since it's basic html the functionality of the form is primitive.
